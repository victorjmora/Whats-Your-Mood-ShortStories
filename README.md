# Whats-Your-Mood-Short-Stories 

<img src='./images/book.png' width=200 height=200>

## Description:

Enter your mood or choose a genre and discover a new, randomly-selected short story to read. Submit your own short story with genre tags, too. (Hope it doesn’t get sketchy - moderator? Option for users to flag things) Sort it by genre, rating, alphabet, submission date, etc. Could have a fun graphic front end (cluttered library with lots of items representing the genres all over stacks of books? Click on items - like a magic 8 ball or a teddy bear or a heart shaped jewel or whatever and the object magically interacts, serving up a random story title from the db).

## User Story: 

As an avid story reader 
I want to enter a mood and have a random story generated based on my selection so that I can rate and generate similar stories.
I want to write my own short story for a broader audience so that I can have ratings and reviews for my stories.
