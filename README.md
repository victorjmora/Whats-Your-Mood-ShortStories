# Whats-Your-Mood-Short-Stories


## Our Story
Our teams motivation for building this application was to have a short story library at our fingertips. We wanted the user to experience a quality short story library, where they can browse different generes and explore new authors without all the frustration of reseaching on their own. It solves the common issue many readers face, exploring new genres and finding a new favorite author without having to commit to an entire book.

## Description:

Enter your mood or choose a genre and discover a new, randomly-selected short story to read. Submit your own short story with genre tags to get readers intrested in your writing. Look up an author or feel out your mood through genres. The possibilities are endless. The user has easy access to some of the best short stories without having to drive to a local library or book store to browse. Whether the user prefers a certain genre or just likes the author's style of writing, the "What's Your Mood Short Story Library" is for everyone.  It's easy to use and fun to interact with, the colorfuly library page hooks readers and invites them to stay a little longer. Cozy up to great short stories and amazing authors.
